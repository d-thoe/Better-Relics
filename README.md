# Better Relics
To import your relics, record a screen capture of yourself scrolling through the Sell screen in the Relic Rites menu by holding right on the D-pad to cycle through all your relics. Save the video as an .mp4 file (tested in 1920x1080) and place it in the same folder as the program. Then, launch the program and click the Update Relics button to begin processing.
